# Brain Tumor Classification and Localization using Deep Learning
This project aims to develop a deep learning framework for the classification and localization of brain tumors using multimodal MRI scans. The project utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as MobileNet, ResNet-101, and NASNet-Mobile, along with a RESUNET architecture, to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI images.

Key Features:
Utilized transfer learning to enhance model accuracy and efficiency.
Evaluated the performance of different CNN architectures on the TCGA Brain Tumor MRI dataset.
Developed models for both tumor classification and localization within MRI scans.
Implemented pre-processing techniques to enhance image quality and reduce noise.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Compared the proposed approach with existing methodologies, demonstrating superior performance.
Getting Started:
To get started with using the developed models for brain tumor classification and localization, follow the instructions in the respective directories. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed and the dataset is accessible.
